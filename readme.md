[Purpose]
This is a tool for downloading and updating steam workshop content.
It relies on Steam's publicly available tool called SteamCMD.
This tool does not webscrape or anything to that effect and is completely allowed by Steam.
Some games work if you do not actually own the game, some do. I am working on compiling a list of working/nonworking games.
